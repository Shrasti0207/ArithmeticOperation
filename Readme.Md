This project contains sample code for performing arithmetic operations on a list of numbers using Scala. It includes a class named PerformArithmeticOperation which provides methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication  of a list of numbers.
The PerformArithmeticOperation class provides four methods for arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
